# GPS-TOLL-SYSTEM-SIMULATION
GPS TOLL SYSTEM SIMULATION USING PYTHON

The GPS Toll-based System simulation using Python aims to create a scalable solution that accurately calculates tolls based on vehicle movements tracked by GPS. This involves simulating vehicle movements, defining toll zones, calculating distances traveled, and computing toll charges dynamically. The goal is to develop an efficient, accurate, and user-friendly toll calculation system that enhances the driving experience while ensuring robust security and privacy measuresâ€‹.
